## Implementation Suggestions

1. **Combined Dashboard Approach**:
   - Use Streamlit to create a main dashboard
   - Embed Plotly visualizations for interactive exploration
   - Include toggles for different metrics and models

2. **Performance Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Use pandas for data processing
   - Generate standardized visualizations with seaborn/matplotlib
   - Export results as interactive HTML with Plotly

3. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Set up Grafana to monitor system performance during tests
   - Create custom panels for LLM-specific metrics
   - Compare resource utilization across hardware configurations

4. **Comparative Analysis Framework**:
   - Build a spider/radar chart showing multiple dimensions of performance
   - Create parallel coordinates plots to visualize relationships between hardware specs and performance
   - Generate heatmaps comparing accuracy across different prompt types and models

These tools will help you not only visualize the raw performance data but also gain deeper insights into how different hardware configurations affect various aspects of LLM performance with your Ollama models.
