Your project planning document is quite comprehensive! However, I've identified several areas that could benefit from additional detail or clarification. Here's my analysis:

## Missing or Unclear Elements:

### **Technical Architecture & Security**
- **Database Schema**: No mention of MySQL table structures for users, documents, search results, etc.
- **Authentication System**: JWT tokens, session management, password hashing strategy not specified
- **File Storage Strategy**: Where/how documents are stored on Mac Mini (file system structure, naming conventions)
- **API Design**: No REST API endpoints defined for client-server communication
- **Data Privacy/Security**: Encryption at rest, secure file transfer protocols, GDPR compliance considerations

### **Development & Deployment**
- **Version Control**: Git repository structure, branching strategy
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing
- **Deployment Process**: How updates will be distributed, rollback procedures
- **Environment Configuration**: Development, staging, production environment setup
- **Backup & Recovery**: Database backups, document backup strategies

### **User Experience & Functionality**
- **Error Handling**: User feedback for failed operations, network issues, etc.
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators for document processing, AI operations
- **File Upload Limits**: Maximum file sizes, supported document formats
- **Search Results Display**: How results are presented, pagination, sorting
- **User Permissions**: Admin vs regular user roles, document sharing capabilities

### **Integration & Dependencies**
- **Ollama Integration**: Specific API calls, model management, error handling
- **Document Processing**: Text extraction from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- **Internationalization**: Language files structure, translation management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Logging, analytics, performance metrics

### **Business & Legal**
- **Pricing Tiers**: Specific pricing structure details
- **Terms of Service**: User agreements, data usage policies
- **Support Documentation**: Knowledge base content structure
- **Installation Process**: Detailed USB installation procedures, system requirements

### **Technical Specifications**
- **System Requirements**: Minimum Mac Mini specs, storage requirements
- **Network Requirements**: Bandwidth needs, offline capabilities
- **Browser Compatibility**: Supported browsers for web interface
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing strategy, query optimization

## Recommendations:

1. **Create detailed wireframes** for both web and desktop interfaces
2. **Define API specification** with endpoints, request/response formats
3. **Establish database schema** with relationships and constraints
4. **Plan security implementation** including encryption and authentication flows
5. **Define testing procedures** and quality assurance processes
6. **Create deployment checklist** with rollback procedures
7. **Document system requirements** and compatibility matrices

Would you like me to help you develop any of these missing areas in more detail?
